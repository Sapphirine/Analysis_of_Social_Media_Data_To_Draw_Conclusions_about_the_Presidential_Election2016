There are three directories in the repository
1. scraper : Used to crawl tweet data.
2. bda_lda : Used to preprocess and apply LDA to the data.
3. wordcloud : The word-cloud-master file has an examples folder with the code used to generate the word cloud that can be seen in "flag.png" in that folder and also in the report. Outside the word-cloud-master folder there is a word cloud preprocessing python file and excel sheets that have been saved as csv files to pass through the preprocessing code. Also, the results after preprocessing are there in the folder along with the word cloud png files .
